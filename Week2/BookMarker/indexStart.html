<!--    Use html 5 input attributes to make sure that the url and description are provided.
        The url should be a valid url too.
    -   At this point the user enters the url and the description.  After we talk about
        making an ajax call in chapter 3, we'll get the image and the title from an api.
    Add one or more sample bookmarks to the html page.
    -   Each bookmark is a link that contains: an image, 
        and the text that the user sees.  It also has a description and an icon for deleting.
    -   Don't forget the event handler on the control that deletes the bookmark
    Style the list of bookmarks and the page as a whole so it is reasonably attractive
    -   I have provided a screen shot of my page as well as 
        a screen shot of what my page looks like when I'm adding a new bookmark.-->
